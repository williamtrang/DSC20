Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I am happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I am happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I am happy
Clap along if you feel like that is what you wanna do
Uh, bring me down Happy, happy, happy, happy
Cannot nothing Happy, happy, happy, happy
Bring me down, my level is too high
To bring me down Happy, happy, happy, happy
Cannot nothing Happy, happy, happy, happy
Bring me down, I said
